## Risk Management

* We want dynamic lot sizes in regards to the equity

### Trend change

When aa trend changes use indicators to check:

* weather to close postiions or not

* Dont market buy on first candle use limit orders - wicks are very prone in reversal and trend areas.

* Move all open position stop losses near the new trend candle

* One market order and one limit order as standard
